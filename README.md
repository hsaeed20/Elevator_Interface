**Example of an Elevator With Issues:**

**Problems With the Current Design**
- The elevator has a delay when you're about to land at a floor so you do not know if the elevator has truly reached the floor. 
- The buttons lack a sound cue when you press it. 
- The button that closes the door has a delay.
- What does the star on floor one mean?

**Why the Design is Bad**
- Why is there an alarm and help button? They should both be the same.
- The design of most conventional elevators such as this have not evolved. 

**Common Uses in Elevators**
- Seeing the outline light up when pressing a button
- Having a "Help" button
- Floor Numbers usually contain the name of the floors either on or above the button
- When the floor is selected, a sound queue is heard to signify that the floor has been selected. 

**Rare Uses in Elevators**
- The voice on the elevator telling you what floor you are on.
- Some elevators have touch screen panels that are not common in most elevators.
- Elevator music is not as common in certain areas of the country. 

**Does the Interface Make Doing These Common Things Easier?** 
- Because these common feature are on the elevator (except for the sound queue when pushing a button), I would say yes but it does not hurt to evolve your design as well. 

**What are the Common Sequence of Actions When the User Interacts With the Elevator?**
- Usually, they would first press the desired floor they would like to go to. Then, they focus on having the door close and then wait for the elevator to take them to their desired floor. 

**How Does the Elevator Support the User Figure Out How to Make it Work?**
- They figure it out by first seeing the button placement and then navigate to see where their floor is.
- They also go ahead and make sure if the floor selected has been highlighted. 

**How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?**
- It provides them feedback by showing the user the button that has been selected has been highlighted. 
- As they go through the process of reaching their destination, they will hear a beeping noise signifying that they are passing through certain floors of the elevator.  

**What Are Common Mistakes that One Could Make With This Current Design?**
- Someone could possibly get confused on the alert and help button since one could be led to believe they mean the same thing given the circumstances.
- Someone may be initially confused on why the elevator doors has not opened even though the floor number says otherwise. 

**Improvements to the Control Interface**
- An inclusion of a mini-map to see where the elevator is at.
- Seeing the date and time of the day so that it would not be necessary for one to look at their phone or if they are carrying something with both of their hands.
- Having only one help button that acts as a way to give an option to provide either an emergency alarm or a guide on how to use the elevator. 

**Screen Size for Touch Screen**
-  600 x 650
