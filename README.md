**Problems With the Current Design**
- The elevator has a delay when you're about to land at the floor. 
- The buttons lack a sound cue when you press it. 
- The button that closes the door has a delay. 

**Why the Design is Bad**
- Lack of a voice telling you what floor you are on or when you are going up/down.
- The design of most conventional elevators such as this have not evolved.
