**Example of an Elevator With Issues:**

**Problems With the Current Design**
- The elevator has a delay when you're about to land at a floor so you do not know if the elevator has truly reached the floor. 
- The buttons lack a sound cue when you press it. 
- The button that closes the door has a delay.
- What does the star on floor one mean?

**Why the Design is Bad**
- Why is there an alarm and help button? They should both be the same.
- The design of most conventional elevators such as this have not evolved. 

**Common Uses in Elevators**
- Seeing the outline light up when pressing a button
- Having a "Help" button
- Floor Numbers usually contain the name of the floors either on or above the button

**Rare Uses in Elevators**
- The voice on the elevator telling you what floor you are on.
- Some elevators have touch screen panels that are not common in most elevators.
- Elevator music is not as common in certain areas of the country. 

**Does the Interface Make Doing These Common Things Easier?** 
- Because these common feature are on the elevator, I would say yes but it does not hurt to evolve your design as well. 

**Screen Size for Touch Screen**
-  600 x 650
